# Simulation Solvers

BioNetGen Playground provides a comprehensive set of simulation methods for rule-based models.

## Detailed Solvent Overview

The playground features three main classes of solvers, all of which are accelerated using **Web Workers** and **WASM** to ensure high performance and a smooth, zero-latency UI experience.

### 1. **Stiff ODE Solver (CVODE)**
**Primary Choice for Deterministic Systems**

BioNetGen Playground uses the **SUNDIALS CVODE** library, compiled to WebAssembly (WASM), for simulating reaction networks. CVODE's adaptive time-stepping and stiff solver capabilities (using BDF methods) make it the industry standard for biological systems.

- **Stiff Sensitivity**: Automatically detects and solves stiff systems.
- **Precision**: High numerical accuracy for large reaction networks.
- **WASM Acceleration**: Native-speed ODE integration directly in the browser.

Functional-rate bytecode is validated before the native WASM network is loaded.
Invalid operands, indices, opcodes, or stack depth reject the native binding,
log the reason, and leave the JavaScript RHS active. Sparse analytical Jacobians
are used only for mass-action networks; functional-rate networks use dense
CVODE's internal difference-quotient Jacobian.

### 2. **Network-Free Simulator (NFsim)**
**For Extremely Large or Infinite State Spaces**

For models where network generation is impractical (e.g., due to combinatorial complexity), the playground integrates a WASM-compiled version of **NFsim**.

- **No Network Needed**: Simulates rules directly without expanding the full reaction network.
- **Stochastic Accuracy**: Provides exact stochastic trajectories for models that cannot be modeled as ODEs.
- **WASM Integration**: Full support for `nfsim.wasm` with client-side result streaming.

### 3. **Stochastic Simulation (SSA)**
**For Molecular Noise Analysis**

A native TypeScript implementation of the Gillespie Direct Method (SSA) is available for exact stochastic modeling of smaller systems where discrete effects are important.

- **Discrete Particles**: Tracks individual molecule copies.
- **Exact Stochasticity**: Accounts for molecular noise and fluctuations.

## Symmetry Reduction with Nauty

For large reaction networks, the playground uses **Nauty WASM** to perform fast canonical labeling and symmetry reduction. This significantly accelerates both network generation and simulation by mapping identical molecular states to the same canonical form.
