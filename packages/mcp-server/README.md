# BioNetGen Playground MCP Server

This package exposes the BioNetGen Playground engine as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for constructing, validating, simulating, calibrating, analyzing, and exporting BNGL models. The default `stable` profile has 36 task-oriented tools; the opt-in `full` profile has 45 tools including legacy compatibility aliases.

The server uses the MCP TypeScript SDK v2 and advertises protocol version `2026-07-28`. It supports local `stdio` and Streamable HTTP through the exported `serveMcpStdio` and `createHttpHandler` entry points. The default profile is intentionally compact and keeps legacy aliases out of ordinary tool discovery.

> **Repository-only package:** `@bngplayground/mcp-server` is not currently published to npm. Do not configure a client with `npx @bngplayground/mcp-server`; launch it from a local clone as described below.

## Prepare the repository

Use Node.js 20 or newer. Install dependencies and build the engine and MCP
server packages from the repository root:

```bash
npm install
npm run build -w @bngplayground/engine
npm run build -w @bngplayground/mcp-server
```

Set `BNG_MCP_PROFILE=full` only when a client still needs the legacy aliases.
The server defaults to `BNG_MCP_PROFILE=stable`.

The MCP server build also creates the self-contained HTML bundle used by the
interactive result views. Re-run it after changing files under
`packages/mcp-server/apps/` or the reused chart/contact-map components.

The most reliable local launch uses absolute paths to Node, the repository's `tsx` CLI, and the server source file. Find Node with `command -v node` on macOS/Linux or `where.exe node` on Windows.

| Platform | Command | First argument | Second argument |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | `/absolute/path/to/node` | `/absolute/path/to/julesplayground/node_modules/tsx/dist/cli.mjs` | `/absolute/path/to/julesplayground/packages/mcp-server/src/index.ts` |
| Linux | `/absolute/path/to/node` | `/absolute/path/to/julesplayground/node_modules/tsx/dist/cli.mjs` | `/absolute/path/to/julesplayground/packages/mcp-server/src/index.ts` |
| Windows | `C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe` | `C:\absolute\path\to\julesplayground\node_modules\tsx\dist\cli.mjs` | `C:\absolute\path\to\julesplayground\packages\mcp-server\src\index.ts` |

To smoke-test the launch, run the corresponding command in a terminal:

```bash
# macOS or Linux
/absolute/path/to/node \
  /absolute/path/to/julesplayground/node_modules/tsx/dist/cli.mjs \
  /absolute/path/to/julesplayground/packages/mcp-server/src/index.ts
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
& "C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe" `
  "C:\absolute\path\to\julesplayground\node_modules\tsx\dist\cli.mjs" `
  "C:\absolute\path\to\julesplayground\packages\mcp-server\src\index.ts"
```

A healthy `stdio` server waits for MCP input and may appear silent. Press Ctrl+C to stop the smoke test. Do not add ordinary logging to stdout because it corrupts the MCP protocol; diagnostics must go to stderr.

For a remote deployment, adapt the exported HTTP handler to the host's server
runtime:

```ts
import { createHttpHandler } from '@bngplayground/mcp-server';

const handler = createHttpHandler();
// Pass each Fetch API Request to handler.fetch(request, { ... }) in the host.
```

The HTTP adapter validates Host and Origin headers for localhost deployments,
supports MCP session requests, and keeps the legacy stateless compatibility
mode enabled for clients that do not send a session header.

## Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop reads a local JSON configuration file:

| Platform | Configuration file |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Linux | `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |

On macOS or Linux, add this entry using absolute paths from your machine:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bngplayground": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/node",
      "args": [
        "/absolute/path/to/julesplayground/node_modules/tsx/dist/cli.mjs",
        "/absolute/path/to/julesplayground/packages/mcp-server/src/index.ts"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

On Windows, JSON backslashes must be escaped:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bngplayground": {
      "command": "C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.exe",
      "args": [
        "C:\\absolute\\path\\to\\julesplayground\\node_modules\\tsx\\dist\\cli.mjs",
        "C:\\absolute\\path\\to\\julesplayground\\packages\\mcp-server\\src\\index.ts"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Preserve any other top-level settings or MCP servers already in the file. Fully quit Claude Desktop, reopen it, and inspect its Developer/Connectors settings to confirm that `bngplayground` is running. Claude Desktop's local configuration does not configure Claude.ai or Cowork.

See Anthropic's [local MCP server guide](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/10949351-getting-started-with-local-mcp-servers-on-claude-desktop) for the current Claude Desktop workflow.

## Claude Code

Claude Code can register the same local process. Run one of these commands after replacing every example path:

```bash
# macOS or Linux
claude mcp add bngplayground --scope user -- \
  /absolute/path/to/node \
  /absolute/path/to/julesplayground/node_modules/tsx/dist/cli.mjs \
  /absolute/path/to/julesplayground/packages/mcp-server/src/index.ts
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
claude mcp add bngplayground --scope user -- `
  "C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe" `
  "C:\absolute\path\to\julesplayground\node_modules\tsx\dist\cli.mjs" `
  "C:\absolute\path\to\julesplayground\packages\mcp-server\src\index.ts"
```

Verify the saved entry with `claude mcp get bngplayground` and inspect connection status with `/mcp` inside Claude Code.

## Codex

Codex CLI and the Codex desktop app share MCP configuration. Register the server from a terminal:

```bash
# macOS or Linux
codex mcp add bngplayground -- \
  /absolute/path/to/node \
  /absolute/path/to/julesplayground/node_modules/tsx/dist/cli.mjs \
  /absolute/path/to/julesplayground/packages/mcp-server/src/index.ts
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
codex mcp add bngplayground -- `
  "C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe" `
  "C:\absolute\path\to\julesplayground\node_modules\tsx\dist\cli.mjs" `
  "C:\absolute\path\to\julesplayground\packages\mcp-server\src\index.ts"
```

Verify it with `codex mcp get bngplayground`. Start a new Codex task or restart the client after changing MCP configuration because an already-running task may retain its original tool inventory. See the official [Codex MCP documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp/) for configuration details.

## Remote clients: ChatGPT, Claude.ai, and Cowork

The local commands above cannot be pasted into a remote connector form.

- **ChatGPT chats/custom MCP apps:** deploy `createHttpHandler()` behind a public HTTPS **Streamable HTTP** MCP endpoint, or expose it with OpenAI's Secure MCP Tunnel. Enable developer mode, create the app/plugin, and enter that endpoint URL. See OpenAI's [connect and test guide](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/deploy/connect-chatgpt/).
- **Claude.ai and Claude Cowork:** add a remote custom connector URL under Customize > Connectors. A local Claude Desktop `claude_desktop_config.json` entry is not available to these products. The present `stdio` server must likewise be hosted behind a supported remote MCP endpoint. See Anthropic's [remote MCP connector guide](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11175166-get-started-with-custom-connectors-using-remote-mcp).

The hosted endpoint and its authentication policy are deployment concerns and are not currently included in this package. Add authentication at the deployment boundary; do not put credentials in BNGL, RuleHub model IDs, or tool arguments.

## Interactive result views (MCP Apps)

The `parse_bngl`, `simulate`, `parameter_scan`, `validate_model`, and
`get_contact_map` tools advertise MCP App resources. A host
that supports the official `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui` extension can render:

- model summaries, reaction-rule inventories, regulatory graphs, and rule-influence maps;
- simulation trajectories with series toggling, isolation, scaling, and zoom;
- one-parameter response curves and two-parameter heatmaps;
- grouped parser, model, observable, and NFsim validation diagnostics;
- contact maps with the existing Cytoscape layouts and fit controls.

Both views reuse the website's React components and are bundled into one
self-contained, sandboxed HTML resource. The resource declares no network,
frame, or external asset origins. Hosts without MCP Apps support continue to
receive the same text and `structuredContent` tool results; the UI metadata is
an optional enhancement rather than a new requirement.

## Capabilities and profiles

The authoritative names, contrastive routing descriptions, schemas, handlers,
and profile membership are registered in [`src/toolRegistry.ts`](src/toolRegistry.ts).

Stable tools (36): `parse_bngl`, `generate_network`, `simulate`,
`parameter_scan`, `validate_model`, `get_contact_map`, `fit_parameters`,
`import_petab`, `reduce_model`, `qssa_reduction`, `sobol_sensitivity`,
`identifiability_analysis`, `bayesian_inference`, `optimal_experiment`,
`compute_fim`, `edit_model`, `diagnose_model`, `explain_model`, `verify_model`,
`bifurcation_analysis`, `temporal_analysis`, `symbolic_steady_state`,
`compare_models`, `search_structure`, `check_hysteresis`, `check_phase_handoff`,
`pkpd`, `multiscale_simulation`, `perturbation_screen`, `dose_response`,
`first_passage_time`, `lna_analysis`, `reaction_information_flow`,
`export_model`, `query_pathway_commons`, and `search_models`.

Full-only legacy aliases (9): `compose_model`, `suggest_fix`, `diagnose`,
`analyze_residuals`, `assess_model_maturity`, `export_omex`, `export_sbml`,
`export_sedml`, and `suggest_annotations`. Prefer direct BNGL authoring plus
`edit_model` for new models, and prefer `export_model` for interchange formats.

Example requests to an MCP-enabled assistant include:

- “Validate this BNGL model and explain every error.”
- “Simulate this model with SSA from 0 to 100 seconds and return only observables.”
- “Run a parameter scan over `k_on` and compare the peak response.”
- “Export this model as SBML and suggest appropriate annotations.”

For token-efficient simulations, set `output_mode` to `observables_only`. The default `full` mode also returns expanded network and species trajectory data.

## RuleHub discovery and exact model reads

`search_models` queries the canonical RuleWorld/RuleHub manifest and returns
metadata, scores, and read-only `rulehub://model/{id}` resource links. Read the
returned resource when exact BNGL source and provenance are needed. The shared
`@bngplayground/rulehub` package provides manifest normalization, compatibility
filters, lexical fallback search, and safe model-path resolution; ordinary
simulation tools do not fetch arbitrary URLs.

## Verification and autoresearch

From the repository root, run the protocol smoke checks with:

```bash
npm run test:mcp-inspector
npm run test:mcp-conformance
```

The conformance harness is pinned to the reviewed MCP requirements package and
uses the `2026-07-28` requirement set. The Jules autoresearch workflow performs
deterministic target selection, multistart sessions with `autoPr: false`, patch
extraction, locked-path checks, fresh-base worktree evaluation, deterministic
ranking, and artifact-first promotion. A pull request is opened only by the
explicit promotion job after a winner passes all hard guards; no autoresearch
job auto-merges.

## Troubleshooting

- **`npm` returns 404 for `@bngplayground/mcp-server`:** the package is not published. Use a local clone and the source launch documented above.
- **`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` mentions `@bngplayground/engine`:** run `npm install` and then `npm run build -w @bngplayground/engine` from the repository root.
- **The client cannot find Node or `tsx`:** use absolute paths. Confirm that the Node executable, `node_modules/tsx/dist/cli.mjs`, and `packages/mcp-server/src/index.ts` all exist.
- **The server disconnects immediately:** run the exact command manually and inspect stderr. Check for malformed JSON, unescaped Windows backslashes, stale paths, or a missing engine build.
- **The client still shows an old tool list:** fully restart Claude Desktop, or start a new Codex/Claude Code session after changing the MCP configuration.
- **An interactive result says its bundle is unavailable:** run `npm run build -w @bngplayground/mcp-server` from the repository root, then restart the MCP client.
- **Random timeouts from a cloud-synced checkout:** MCP startup reads many repository and dependency files. Keep the clone and `node_modules` fully downloaded, mark them “Always Keep on This Device,” or move the clone to a non-synced local directory. Cloud placeholders can cause intermittent startup and module-resolution failures.
- **Claude Desktop logs:** use its Developer settings to open the MCP logs and inspect the `bngplayground` server's stderr output.
